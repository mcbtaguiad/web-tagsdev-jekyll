Back in 2021, I've deployed my first website [mark.tagsdev.xyz](https://mark.tagsdev.xyz) running on Django as its web framework. But a little content or progress was publish in it. This decision was to enable me to focus more on content creation and DevOps related projects/learnings.



### Why Django?

It has been a journey, everything was built from scratch, from html/js/cs to integrating it to the web framework and building it into container. Django wasn't my first web framework that I used, I created my first API using Flask. But I have always been a sucker for more complicated things/technology; hence Django. 

Building my first website/blog on Django is a bit overkill. But this has been my gateway to Web-development to Linux Administration and now being DevOps. 

The old [website](https://mark.tagsdev.xyz) will still be up and running as I intend to keep the development active. 

### Why Hugo?

I needed to migrate the site to something that is lower in maintenance and can easily generate template or pages for my blog/post. Since this translate Markdown language to HTML, I can focus less on thinkering on the codes. 

Hugo is a Fast & Modern Static Website Engine. It's built on top of Go, this would enable me to learn Go or maybe PHP :grin:. 

If you are interested in trying Hugo, please visit this [site](https://gohugo.io/) to get started. It has a good documentation it even covered migration from different provider or from other static site generator.
